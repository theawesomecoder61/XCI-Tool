# XCI-Tool
A Windows program that can view and extract the contents of a Nintendo Switch Cartridge Image (XCI)

## What this does
This tool can view information and the files within a Nintendo Switch cartridge image (XCI). The files are displayed in a treeview and each file can be exported.

## Unfortunately...
XCI Tool **can not decrypt** anything. You will need the decryption key to do so.

## Note
Some files in the XCI files can be ***gigabytes*** in size. I implemented (this hacky solution (it works))[] for exporting them. If you do not like it, please submit an issue.
