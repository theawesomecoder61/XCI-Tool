# XCI-Tool
A Windows program that can view and extract the contents of a Nintendo Switch Cartridge Image (XCI)

## What this does
This tool can view information and the files within a Nintendo Switch Cartridge Image (XCI). The files are displayed in a tree view and each file can be exported. The first 10 MB of the selected file is shown in a hex viewer.

## Building
You will need:
* Visual Studio 2015 or later
* .NET Framework 4.5 or later

1. Clone the repo
2. Open the `.sln` file in Visual Studio
3. `Build > Build Solution`

## Unfortunately...
XCI Tool **can not decrypt** anything. You will need the decryption key to do so.

# Sometime this month...
XCI Tool will become deprecated in favor for a new tool called UltiSwitch. This will include an updated and more organized XCI Tool. UltiSwitch will appear on GitHub sometime March 2018. It will be awesome. ðŸ˜€

## Note
Some files in the XCI files can be ***gigabytes*** in size. I implemented [this hacky solution (hey, it works)](https://github.com/theawesomecoder61/XCI-Tool/blob/master/XCI%20Tool/Form1.cs#L102) for exporting them.
